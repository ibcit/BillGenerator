        <li><a name="100"><b>About This Program</b></a>
        <p>
                IBC Bill Generator is a program that allows you to load consignee information from
                a CSV file.  The program creates physical airwaybills and inputs the pertinent data
                from the CSV file into the IBC database.  
        <p>        
        <li><a name="101"><b>Format of CSV file</b></a>
        <p>
                A CSV file is a text based file that contains information in a comma-delimited format.
                Usually the first line of text displayed, are the headers of the file.
                An example of headers needed for the program are:
                        <ul>
                                <li>NOTES - Field for notes
                                <li>QTY - Field for quantity shipped
                                <li>FULLNAME - Name of Consignee
                                <li>COMPANY - Company name of the Consignee
                                <li>ADDRESS1 - Address for delivery
                                <li>ADDRESS2 - Additional address field
                                <li>CITY - City name 
                                <li>STATE - State name
                                <li>ZIPCODE - Zip Code
                                <li>COUNTRY - Country name
				<li>WEIGHT - Shipment Weight
                        </ul>
                The above fields are not the only fields allowed, the file may contain additional fields,
                which can be used to alter the output of the airbill print jobs. However the above fileds
                are normally saved into the database.
                
                By beign consistent with the entry fields we can assure good transactions are beign generated,
                printed and stored into the database.
        
        <p>
         <li><a name="102"><b>Print and Save Airwaybills from CSV</b></a>
              <p>
                To print the airwaybills from a CSV file follow these steps:
                        <ul>
                                <li>Enter the <a href="help.html#104">shipper information </a>(Edit - Shipper).
				<li>(Optional)<a href="help.html#105">Enter the shipment default information (Edit - Shipment Info).</a>
				<li>(Optional)<a href="help.html#106">Enter the Run Time Settings (Edit - Run Time Settings).</a>
                                <li>Open a file by cliking on the "Open" File Button.
                                <li>Double click to select the file you wish to open.
                                <li>The program will load the entries into the program table.
                                <li>Select the rows you wish to print and save into the database or Select - All.
                                <li>Click on the Print icon to begin the print Process.
                                <li>Next, the "Customize Airbill Printout Page" appears. Simply drag and drop
                                    your column headers, into each Airwaybill field.
                                <li>Once, your headers are arranged, Click Done to continue.
                                <li>Next, the "Printer" Window appears, you can choose the printer to direct
                                    your airwaybills.  Make sure you select the correct printer for the formatting
                                    option specified in the <a href="help.html#103">"Printer" format select menu.</a>
                                <li>Collect the airbills from the printer.  At this time the entries have been saved
                                    into the IBC database.
                        </ul>
         
         <p>
         <li><a name="103"><b>Printer Format Options</b></a>
          <p>
                Currently, the program supports 3 printer format options:
                 <ul>
                        <li>Laser Printer - The Default option which formats airwaybills to print on laser printers.
                        <li>Okidata - Formats output for IBC paper airwaybills on the following models: Okidata 320, Okidata 3410.
                        <li>Lexmark Forms - formats output for NYC's airbill printer.
                 </ul>             		
	<p>
	<li><a name="104"><b>Shipper Default Information</b></a>
	<p>
		This Information must be filled out correctly and corresponds to the IBC Customer that generated the Consignee list
		and is sending the shipments.  It is very important to be accurate with the shipper's Account Number, Reference Number,
		Second Reference number if any, etc.  The Shipper reference number can contain a value that is read directly from the file.
		You can choose to have such value placed in the middle of the reference string by using a wild card value or by default
		at the end of the string. There are three available wild card values (<b>$A, $B, $C</b>) for a maximum of 3 actual entries read from the input file.
		For example, if you needed to create a reference field that contained the Lot Value read from the
		file  you would write a string like this on the value field:  BULK <b>$A</b>, LOT A   Where the $A is the value that is going to
		be read from the file.  You may also repeat that same value later in the string by typing another $A wild card in another place on the reference string.
		By default the first value draged into the reference list when you prepare the output, will be reference to $A, the second to $B and the third to $C.
		If you request 3 entries in your reference string, make sure you pass 3 variables to the drag and drop list, or the print request will stop.  If you
		request 2 variables and pass more than 2 on the drag and drop list, only the referenced values will actually be placed on the reference field.
		Also, by default the reference value(s) will be added at the end of the string if no wild card value is specified. 
		<br>
		You can now load and save your default shipper information into a parameter file. It is prefered to store this files in the default
		selected storage path for easy loading from other users.  Simply click the "Load" or "Save" option from the Shipper Information Box.

	<p>
	<li><a name="105"><b>Shipment Default Information</b></a>
	<p>	
		The shipment default information includes Origin Code, Destination Code, shipment Weight, Value, Number Of Pieces, etc.
		For weight and pieces, the value should be left blank if the file provides this information. 
		From the dropdown boxes you can choose the packaging, terms and contents of the shipment.
		To set each of the above values click on the checkbox and proceed enter the value or select the item from the dropdown box.
		To remove a value, simply un-check the adjacent check-box of the desired value.

	<p>
	<li><a name="106"><b>Run Time Settings</b></a>
	<p>

		There are 4 different Run Time Settings you can edit to change the output on the laser printed airwaybills or to create an output file.
		<ol>
			<li><b>Label Printing</b>: When this option is selected, your printouts will be ready for labels.  These laser labels measure 3.5" by 5" and are only
				   available for a laser printer.  Each label sheet contains 4 of these labels so if you calculate the selected input and divide this number by 4 
				   you will get the exact number of label sheets to be used. Remember to round up to the next whole number. Hint, You can view the Stats (CTRL + t) to
				   view the file statistics.
			<li><b>Airborne Routing</b>: This setting generates the airborne routing codes needed for shipments routed through airborne.
			       This setting is set to on by default. (Only available for US Shipments)Make sure your country value defaults to US, USA, or United States.
			<li><b>ABX Logo</b>: If you are not routing the list through Airborne you can choose to hide the ABX logo from the airwaybills.
			<li><b>Multi Lot Printing</b>: Select this option if you need to generate multiple copies of an Airwaybill and display the MultiLot Message (1 of X)
			       on each of the printed airwaybills. 
			<li><b>Print Output</b>: When this option is selected an output file will be generated inside the output folder. This file contains the consignee information
			       and the airwaybill number that corresponds to that consignee.  The date and time on each entry reflects the time the entry was created.
		</ol>

         <p>
	 <li><a name="107"><b>DataBase</b></a>
	<p>
		Select the Database to Store your data to.  There are currently 3 options
		<ol>
			<li><b>Production:</b> This are for regular distribution lists for US Shipments when the origin is any of the US Stations.
			<li><b>Production LHR:</b> This option is only for London UK lists.
			<li><b>Test:</b> This option will use and store your information on the test Database. This should ONLY be use for test purposes.  The data store on this
				         database will not be avialable on any of the other databases.
		</ol>
	<p>
	<li><a name="108"><b>Weight</b></a>
	<p>
		Select the default weight unit for your distribution list. For example, a distribution list may contain a weight Value and a weight unit of LBS if specified by the
		distributor of the list, or a weight unit of KGS.  By default all of the KGS units will be saved as pounds in the IBC databases, but displayed in either LBS or KGS depending
		on the station's preferences.
